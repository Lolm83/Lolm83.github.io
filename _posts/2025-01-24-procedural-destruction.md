**Abstract**
-
For me, nothing brings a game more cohesion than a world that feels **tangible**. And ever since I decided to study game programming, my goal has been to learn new ways to re-create that feeling myself. It is to this end that I spent the last 8 weeks building a Procedural Destruction System for 3D meshes.

My goal with this blog post is to give a broad overview of how I went about destroying 3D meshes, and hopefully outline enough theory and show enough code that someone who reads this could give it a try themselves.

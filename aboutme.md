title: About me
---

My name is **Noah Modli-Gorodetsky**, a Canadian **game programming student** at **Breda University of Applied Sciences** in the Netherlands. I have a strong passion towards videogames and problem solving, and I'm eager to start working in the industry!

During my studies in Breda, I've learned from the ground-up what it takes to be an effective game developer both solo and in a team, working both on **custom engine** projects, and bringing a game from concept to release in **Unreal**. I'm confident in my **C++** skills but more importantly my ability to learn and grow in this profession. 

I've always felt a unique connection to games which drives me to improve my craft. Videogames stand apart from other entertainment mediums for the unique trait of **dynamism**. A game is not a story being told to you, but a story told through your own actions, and the ways in which the game *responds* to your actions is where I find the greatest impact in the medium. My goal as a game programmer is to foster that essence of dynamism in the games that I develop, and to give the player's involvement in the game the weight and impact it deserves.
